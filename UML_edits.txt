Suggested changes:

1. Manager should be called CaseManager
2. Remove Interviewer, this is the same as a case manager
3. Manager (OfficeId), LabTech(TestingCenterId)
4. Employees do not have TestingCenters, they MAY work at a testing center
5. TestingCenters would exist without Employees, this is an association
6. Employees MAY also work at an Office, we're missing this association
7. Offices do not have TestingCenters, they MAY share the same Address
8. Interviews do not take place at TestingCenters
9. Test would exist without TestingCenter, this is an association
10. The aggregate relationship between TestingCenter and Address is incorrect
11. Contact TAKES 0..* Tests
12. Contact HAS 0..* Interview
13. An Employee CONDUCTS 0..* Interviews, we're missing this relationship
14. Interviews may be held in 0..* Office, we're missing this relationship
15. An Exposure record would exist without a Contact, this is an association
16. A ContactStatus record would not exist without a Contact, this is composition
17. A ContactTravel record would not exist without a Contact, this is composition
18. A ContactSymptom record would not exist without a Contact, this is composition
19. A ContactTravel OCCURS AT 0..* Address
20. I don't know how we would represent generalization in Contact and Employee, lets talk about this together.
