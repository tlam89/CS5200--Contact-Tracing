# DBSM--Contact-Tracing-

This repo is one of the assignments in my Database Management System, in which I was asked to build a database to store information of the infected patients as well as the possibly infected ones. In addition, there are other related information, such as testing centers, testing results, date, etc. which will be used to inform other registere users who have contacted with positive patients. Importantly, the registered users remain anonymous in the alert system.
